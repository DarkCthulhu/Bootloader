Bootloader
==========

x86 bootloader concept: Tested with Bochs

ASM files called `BIOS-*` are to be run in 16-bit real-mode, as the first stage of the bootloader

ASM files labeled `32-bit*` are the second stage bootloader


Assembled using nasm
    `nasm <sourcefile.asm> -o generated.img`
    



`~/.bochsrc` looks like: (where `generated.img` is the output file from nasm)

    # configuration file generated by Bochs
    floppya: 1_44=generated.img, status = inserted
    boot: a
    display_library: sdl
