Bootloader
==========

x86 16-bit real-mode concept: Tested with Bochs as bootloader

Assembled using nasm
    `nasm <sourcefile.asm> -o generated.img`


`~/.bochsrc` looks like: (where `generated.img` is the output file from nasm)

    # configuration file generated by Bochs
    floppya: 1_44=generated.img, status = inserted
    boot: a
    display_library: sdl
