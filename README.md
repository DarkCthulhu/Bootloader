Bootloader implementation concept: Tested with Bochs

Assembled using nasm
nasm <sourcefile.asm> -o generated.img


~/.bochsrc looks like: (where generated.img is the output file from nasm)

# configuration file generated by Bochs
floppya: 1_44=generated.img, status = inserted
boot: a
display_library: sdl
